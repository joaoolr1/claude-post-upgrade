# Agent Upgrade Summary

## Migration Completed Successfully ✅

The agent has been successfully upgraded from the Claude SDK standalone CLI tool to an Agent365 SDK-based agent following all 7 steps in the `AGENT-UPGRADE-GUIDE.md`.

## What Was Done

### Step 1: Package Installation ✅
Installed required packages (with version adjustments for availability):
- `@microsoft/agents-hosting-express@^1.0.15`
- `@microsoft/agents-hosting@^1.0.15`
- `@microsoft/agents-activity@^1.0.15`
- `express@^4.18.0`
- `@microsoft/m365agentsplayground@^0.2.19` (dev dependency)
- Preserved: `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@^0.1.10` (for model queries)

### Step 2: Manifest Files ✅
Created two manifest files:
- `manifest.json` - Teams app manifest with agent metadata
- `agenticUserTemplateManifest.json` - Agent template definition with Activity Protocol specification

### Step 3: Agent Logic ✅
Created `src/agent.js` with:
- `AgentApplicationBuilder` for agent setup
- Activity Protocol message handling via `app.onActivity(ActivityTypes.Message, ...)`
- Preserved original Claude SDK query logic with streaming
- Preserved complete SYSTEM_PROMPT from original agent

### Step 4: Server Application ✅
Created `src/index.js` with:
- Express server setup
- `startServer(app)` from `@microsoft/agents-hosting-express`
- Server runs on http://localhost:3978

### Step 5: Observability ⚠️
**Skipped** - As per guide instructions, when observability packages (`@microsoft/kairo-sdk-observability` and `@azure/monitor-opentelemetry-exporter`) are not available in the registry, this step should be skipped completely.

### Step 6: Environment Variables ✅
Created `.env.example` and `.env` with:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For Claude SDK
- `AZURE_MONITOR_CONNECTION_STRING` - For future observability
- `AGENT_BLUEPRINT_ID` - GUID for agent identity

### Step 7: Test Scripts ✅
Updated `package.json` with:
- `start`: Runs the agent server
- `dev`: Runs with watch mode and auto-reload
- `test-tool`: Opens M365 Agents Playground for testing

## Key Architecture Changes

### Before (claude-pre-upgrade):
```
CLI Tool → process.argv → Claude SDK query() → Stream response → console.log
```

### After (claude-post-upgrade):
```
Express Server → Activity Protocol → Message Handler → Claude SDK query() → Send Activity Response
```

## Preserved Features
- ✅ Complete System Prompt (Senior Backend TypeScript Architect persona)
- ✅ Claude Sonnet 4 model
- ✅ All allowed tools: WebSearch, Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob
- ✅ Streaming response handling
- ✅ Error handling

## New Capabilities
- 🆕 Activity Protocol support (Teams-compatible messaging)
- 🆕 Express server hosting
- 🆕 M365 Agents Playground integration
- 🆕 Manifest-driven configuration
- 🆕 Ready for observability (when packages become available)

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env and add your actual values:
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
   AGENT_BLUEPRINT_ID=<generate-a-guid>
   ```

2. **Start the Agent**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test with Playground** (in a separate terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run test-tool
   ```

```

## Differences from Guide

1. **Package Versions**: Used actual available versions instead of ^1.0.0 placeholders
2. **Observability**: Completely skipped as packages not available (per guide's conditional instruction)
3. **No telemetry.js**: Not created since observability was skipped

All changes align with the guide's conditional instructions for unavailable packages.
